            <p>
                By using BERI, you agree to the following terms. They are written to be straightforward — please read them before using the tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>BERI is an informational tool, not an authority.</strong> BERI helps you navigate school documents and policies, but it does not set or replace official school policy. Any answer BERI provides is drawn from the documents you have loaded into it. Always verify important information against the original source documents or by speaking with the relevant person at your school.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Check answers using citations.</strong> BERI includes citations with its responses so you can trace answers back to the source. We encourage you to use those citations and confirm the information is current and accurate before acting on it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>No warranties or accuracy guarantees.</strong> BERI is provided as-is. We do our best to make it useful and accurate, but we cannot guarantee that every answer will be correct or complete. School documents can change, and BERI can only reflect what has been loaded into it at a given time. Do not rely on BERI as the sole source of truth for decisions that matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Acceptable use.</strong> Please use BERI responsibly. Do not use it to mislead others, to circumvent school policy, or for any purpose that would not be considered appropriate in your school environment. Only upload documents you are authorised to use — do not include confidential or personal information unless you have permission to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Changes to these terms.</strong> These terms may be updated from time to time. We will reflect any changes on this page. Continued use of BERI after changes are made means you accept the updated terms.
            </p>

            <p>
