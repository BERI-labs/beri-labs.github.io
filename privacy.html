            <p>
                BERI is designed to run locally on your device. Documents you provide are processed on-device rather than sent to external servers as part of normal operation. This means your school's policies, handbooks, and resources stay within your own environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Local-first processing.</strong> BERI processes documents on the device where it is installed. We do not upload school documents to third-party servers as part of standard use. As with any software, you should review the environment it runs in and apply appropriate security measures for your context.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>You control what is included.</strong> Schools and users choose which documents are added to BERI. Nothing is included automatically. If you do not add a document, BERI has no access to it. You can update or remove documents at any time by managing your local data.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Data retention.</strong> Data processed by BERI remains on the device. It is not stored on remote servers by us. You can remove local data at any time by clearing the application's local storage or data directory, following the steps in your setup documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>No tracking or analytics by default.</strong> BERI does not collect usage data, analytics, or personal information from students or staff as part of its standard operation.
            </p>

            <p>
